🧠 About Me
I’m passionate about leveraging artificial intelligence and data-driven methods to solve real-world challenges — especially in healthcare, biomedical research, and beyond. My journey began at the University of Waterloo, where I earned my Honours Bachelor’s degree in Psychology Science and built a strong foundation in data analysis and human-centered research. I later expanded this foundation through a Master’s in Biomedical Informatics at Queen’s University, which strengthened my analytical and computational skills and further shaped my focus on machine learning, generative AI, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems as tools to advance scientific and clinical innovation.

I’m currently exploring how AI can augment human expertise — whether in clinical decision support, intelligent data retrieval, or predictive analytics.
